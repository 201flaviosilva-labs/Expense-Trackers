# To-Do-Lists

## Description

A collection of languages/Frameworks implementations of a basic To Do List.

Inspired by this Breakout game recreation project in various JS Engines: https://github.com/city41/breakouts

## Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

This is the MVP base for all App implementations:

- Add an individual task;
- Search bar to filter the task with the current input;
- Filters (complete, incomplete);
- Save/load state to/from localstorage;
- Individually remove/complete/edit a task;
- Clear all tasks (with a confirmation modal);
